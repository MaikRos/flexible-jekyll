For those of you who are looking for new opportunities in data science - have you ever wondered which factors influence whether you are invited
to an interview after sending your application? 

So did I. I send out approximately 100 applications during the first 2 months of my data science career switch and received little to no feedback - which bugged me, a lot. 
What I did was send out a CV with picture, all the courses I had taken and my personal scale of skills - apparently not something companies were looking for.

I subsequently decided to switch my approach and to automate the CV generation as well as application sending process. In the upcoming weeks I will share what I did and how.

For now here is my current CV - more will come!
